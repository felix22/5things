            <p>Dear Knowledge Worker with more work than time,</p>
            <p><strong>When was the last time you got to the buttom of your to-do list?</strong></p>
            <p>Most to-do lists never get done; they are often too long and when we often run out of time (or give up on the list) before we get to the "important tasks" </p>
            <p class="small">Did you know: "41% of toÂ­-do items were never completed."</p>
            <p>They are often too long and we often run out of time (or give up on the list) before we get to the "important tasks"</p>
            <p><strong>A Better Way</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Write down up to 5 very-important things you need to do todayy</li>
                  <li>Start with #1</li>
                  <li>don't stop (except for breaks) until you're done</li>
              </ul> 
                    

              <p>That's it! Doo this and you'll never have an unproductive day again.</p>
              <p>We're making an app - 5 things - that  helps you focus ONLY on the most-important things that you need to do every day; so that at the end of the day, even if you don't have time to do anything else, you'll have done the most important things you needed to do that day.</p>
              <p>If you're interested in such an app, Please enter your name and email address below and I'll let you know when the app is available for you to test.</p>
